Observations:

1. Apparently, Capomulin is an effective drug to treat this cancer as the tumour size in the mouse ID f966 decreased with the time.
2. I can distinguish a positive correlation between the weight of the mouse and the tumour size because of the 0.84 value of this linear correlation.
3. From the four drugs studied, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective. It is highly recommended to keep studying the two drugs.
